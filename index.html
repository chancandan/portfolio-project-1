            <h3>Tin Hau Temple</h3>
            <p>Tin Hau Temple was built in about 1785. The Temple is dedicated to Goddess Tin Hau. The Temple of Tin Hau
                is the oldest temple of Taipa and hence many historical relics have been preserved here. Built in the
                Qian Long Reign, the main palace is dedicated to the Empress, with a lot of cultural relics inside.<br>

                The Tin Hau-which means Heavenly Empress-Temple is located close to the Museum of Taipa and Coloane
                History. The temple underwent a restoration in the mid-19th century after a tragic incident involving
                sea pirates that invaded the Taipa area. Several people were injured and got killed while fighting the
                pirates. The family of the dead then used the government's and the rich locals' donations to rebuild the
                temple in honor of their family members.<br>

                Opening hours: Daily, 9:00am-6:00pm</p>

            <h3>The Macau Tower</h3>
            <p>Macau Tower is 338 meters (about 1,108 feet) above the ground. The highest observation level is the
                Outdoor Observation Deck on Level 61, with a height of 223 meters (about 732 feet). Walking around the
                Observation Deck, you can have a panoramic view of the Peal River Delta, Macau Peninsula and Taipa,
                Coloane islands.<br>
                The Observation Lounge is on Level 58. Macau Tower is a fascinating place to see the
                sunrise in the morning or see the spectacular night-view of Macau. Looking down, you can see the East
                and west Mangyang Hill, Casino Lisboa and even the outlying island of Hong Kong in sunny days.</p>

            <h3>Ruins of St. Paul's</h3>
            <p>Arguably Macau's most famous landmark, the Ruins of St. Paul's continue to captivate visitors centuries
                after it was originally constructed. Today, most tourists who visit the ruins probably only see the
                remains of a beautiful old church, but there's more to its story. In fact, the ruins serve as a key
                reminder of Macau's unique roots.<br>

                Constructed from 1602 to 1640 by Jesuit priests who travelled to the Far East to spread Catholicism, the
                site originally included St. Paul's College and the Church of St. Paul, also known as “Mater Dei”, a
                Portuguese church dedicated to Saint Paul the Apostle.</p>

            <h3>The World's Gambling Capital</h3>
            <p>Gambling in Macau has been legal since the 1850s when the Portuguese government legalised the activity in
                the autonomous colony. Since then, Macau has become known worldwide as the "Gambling capital of the
                world or "Monte Carlo of the East"<br>

                Gambling tourism is Macau's biggest source of revenue, making up about 50% of the economy. Visitors are
                largely from mainland China. With the entry of large foreign casinos from Las Vegas and
                Australia, Macau overtook the Las Vegas Strip in gambling revenues in 2007.</p>
